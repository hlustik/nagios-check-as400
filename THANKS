Thanks
---------------

*Hats off to Goran Almvik for helping me test the plugin on varying versions of OS/400.

*To Boer, André for submitting his debug logs. Thus enabling me to change some things so they would be language independent. Also for converting things to German.

*To everyone for there input with bugs and patches, and for being patient with me! 

Thanks,
