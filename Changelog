0.17
-----------
*Minor code cleanups

*Added check to see if a login completes.  Use it in dependency definitions
 for about every other service you monitor. If the login fails, it obviously
 cant check anything. All your checks will return error unable to login.
 This will prevent one from getting a zillion alerts in the middle of the night.
 (Not that I would know anything about that!)

*Fixed problem with active jobs not retrieving properly(parse problem).

*Fixed wrksyssts and dspmsg to execute with proper assistance level and
 modified parsing accordingly.
 
To make things language independent:

*Modified the way the variables CPU,DB,US,JOBS,SBS,AJ,CJ are parsed.
 (All but the CJ, MSG and OUTQ variables should work regardless of langauge) 

*Changed the way the "...is allocated..." message is found during logon.
 (To make it work across languages)

*Added a check on the double conversion for cases where a ',' is used
 instead of a '.'

*Modified parsing on CJ variable when job not found

0.18
-----------
*Changed the name of the command vars class(CmdVars.java) to 
 check_as400_cmd_vars.java for standardization

*Created LANG class and substituted on language depended strings
 with constants from LANG class
